Source code accompanying the paper ["Octree Generating Networks: Efficient Convolutional Architectures for High-resolution 3D Outputs"](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/tatarchm/ogn/) by M. Tatarchenko, A. Dosovitskiy and T. Brox. The implementation is based on [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), and extends the basic framework by providing layers for octree-specific features.

## Build
For compilation instructions please refer to the [official](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) or [unofficial](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Ubuntu-16.04-or-15.10-Installation-Guide) cmake build guidelines for Caffe.

## Data
Octrees are stored as text-based serialized std::map containers. The provided utility (tools/ogn_converter) can be used to convert [binvox](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Programs_and_editors/Binvox) voxel grids into octrees. Three of the datasets used in the paper (ShapeNet-cars, FAUST and BlendSwap) can be downloaded from [here](http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/data/ogn/data.zip). For ShapeNet-all, we used the voxelizations(ftp://cs.stanford.edu/cs/cvgl/ShapeNetVox32.tgz) and the renderings(ftp://cs.stanford.edu/cs/cvgl/ShapeNetRendering.tgz) provided by Choy et al. for their [3D-R<sup>2</sup>N<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/chrischoy/3D-R2N2) framework.

## Usage
Example models can be downloaded from [here](http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/data/ogn/examples.zip). Run one of the scripts (train_known.sh, train_pred.sh or test.sh) from the corresponding experiment folder. You should have the caffe executable in your $PATH.

## Visualization
There is a python script for visualizing .ot files in Blender. To use it, run
	
	$ blender -P $CAFFE_ROOT/python/rendering/render_model.py your_model.ot
